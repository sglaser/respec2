            Publication as {{anOrA}} {{textStatus}} does not imply endorsement by the W3C

            This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C
            groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation.
            It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another
            document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the
            specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality
            and interoperability of the Web.
